        <h2 class="full_career_history_resume_subheader">Skill Summary:</h2>

            <p class="full_career_history_resume_paragraph">I am a disciplined self-starter with over 8 years of finance, auditing, and compliance-related experience. Due to my experience in the finance industry and the completion of my MBA at the top of my class, I now excel in completing work in both a position within a team setting and a position without direct supervision. I have learned what it takes to lead annual audits in a highly regulated industry.</p>
            <ul class="full_career_history_resume_ul">
                <li class="full_career_history_resume_li">Expert in decentralized command, teamwork, and delegating tasks. Each week I host weekly online training and compliance overviews for over 300 agents across the southeast region. During these trainings, it is imperative that I delegate roles to ensure that all pertinent topics can be covered in a timely and efficient manner.</li>
                <li class="full_career_history_resume_li">With a client base in the 1,000s and over $1 billion in assets under management, I have learned to excel in presentation, customer service, and conflict resolution.</li>
                <li class="full_career_history_resume_li">Strong attention to detail. When filling out applications I must ensure that all paperwork is filled out properly and all rules and regulations are followed in the storing and submission of the paperwork. Additionally, I must check the work of other agents and ensure all protocols have been properly followed.</li>
